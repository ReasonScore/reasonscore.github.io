            Reason Score is a process where:
                <ul style="text-align: left; margin: auto; max-width: 270px;">
                    <li>your facts are heard</li>
                    <li>their facts are explored</li>
                    <li>we take action together</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            <h2>Be heard and understand</h2>

            <p class="mb-0">“One of the biggest challenges that we have to our democracy is the degree to which we do not share a common

        <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
        <blockquote>Would you trust a cashier at a grocery store to total your bill in their head?</blockquote>
        <p>Two people looking at a shopping cart and guessing the total price usually disagree. It’s no wonder that after reading
            several articles or listening to a debate that people have different opinions. Even just a 10% increase in agreement
            would be a huge improvement in what people can accomplish together.

        <h2>A Cash Register for Decisions</h2>
        Reason Score:
        <ul>
            <li>tracks all the reasons for and against a decision</li>
            <li>keeps score as we explore their weight and importance</li>
            <li>organizes the reasons so you don’t have to read them all to understand</li>
            <li>the reasons you put in can not be dismissed (because they immediately affect the score)</li>
        </ul>
