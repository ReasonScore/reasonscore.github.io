        <blockquote>Would you trust a cashier at a grocery store to total your bill in their head?</blockquote>
        <p>Two people looking at a shopping cart and guessing the total price usually disagree. It’s no wonder that after reading
            several articles or listening to a debate that people have different opinions. Even just a 10% increase in agreement
            would be a huge improvement in what people can accomplish together.

        <ul>
            <li>tracks all the reasons for and against a decision</li>
            <li>keeps score as we explore their weight and importance</li>
            <li>organizes the reasons so you don’t have to read them all to understand</li>
            <li>the reasons you put in can not be dismissed (because they immediately affect the score)</li>
