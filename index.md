            Reason Score is a process where:
            <ul style="        text-align: left;
                margin: auto;
                max-width: 270px;">
                <li>your facts are heard</li>
                <li>their facts are tested</li>
                <li>we take action together</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h2>Be heard and understand</h2>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <blockquote style="padding-bottom:20px; max-width: 600px; margin: auto;">
            <p>“One of the biggest challenges that we have to our democracy is the degree to which we do not share a common
                baseline of facts.” - Barack Obama</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
        <blockquote>Would you trust a cashier at a grocery store to total your bill in their head?</blockquote>
        <p>Two people looking at a shopping cart and guessing the total price usually disagree. It’s no wonder that after reading
            several articles or listening to a debate that people have different opinions. Even just a 10% increase in agreement
            would be a huge improvement in what people can accomplish together.

        <h2>A Cash Register for Decisions</h2>
        Reason Score:
        <ul>
            <li>tracks all the reasons for and against a decision</li>
            <li>keeps score as we explore their weight and importance</li>
            <li>organizes the reasons so you don’t have to read them all to understand</li>
            <li>the reasons you put in can not be dismissed (because they immediately affect the score)</li>
        </ul>
